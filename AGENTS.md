# Move Beyond Tournament Management — agent notes

- Spec: `docs/move_beyond_tournament_management_spec.md`. README has the architecture summary.
- Supabase project id: `dwyztzywuscljqklhqij` (org `zigybnrxlgipryfgqvia`). Schema was applied
  via the Supabase MCP migration `init_tournament_schema`.
- All DB access is server-side through `src/lib/supabase.ts` (`db()`); the key is NOT public.
  Do not add `NEXT_PUBLIC_` Supabase env vars without first tightening RLS.
- Pure domain logic lives in `src/lib/` (scoring engine, round-robin, draws, standings,
  bracket) with vitest coverage — keep it framework-free. Server mutations live in
  `src/lib/ops.ts` and route/page `actions.ts` files.
- Offline referee scoring: Dexie queue in `src/lib/offline/db.ts`, sync endpoint
  `src/app/api/matches/[matchId]/events/route.ts` (ordered events, device lock, 409 conflicts).
- Verify with: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx vitest run`, `npm run build`, and the
  live-DB E2E: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/smoke.ts` (creates + deletes its own data).
